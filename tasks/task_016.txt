# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Comprehensive UI Design System for LightRAG Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create and implement a cohesive design system for the LightRAG Agent that enhances visual appeal and user experience while maintaining functionality.
# Details:
This task involves creating a comprehensive design system for the LightRAG Agent interface once core functionality is stable. The developer should:

1. Create a consistent color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors that follow accessibility guidelines (minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1)
2. Implement a typography system with appropriate font families, sizes, and weights for different UI elements (headings, body text, buttons, etc.)
3. Establish consistent spacing using a grid system or spacing scale (8px increments recommended)
4. Design and implement subtle animations for state changes, transitions between views, and user interactions (loading states, hover effects, etc.)
5. Enhance component styling for all UI elements including:
   - Input fields and search bars
   - Buttons and action items
   - Results display area
   - Navigation elements
   - Modal dialogs and notifications
6. Implement responsive design principles to ensure the interface works well across different screen sizes
7. Create visual hierarchy through effective use of whitespace, color, and typography
8. Add subtle visual feedback for user actions (hover states, active states, etc.)
9. Ensure all UI elements maintain a consistent visual language
10. Document the design system components for future reference and consistency

The implementation should use CSS variables or a styling framework like Tailwind CSS for maintainability. All styling changes should enhance but not interfere with the existing functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the visual implementation and user experience improvements:

1. Visual Regression Testing:
   - Capture screenshots of the interface before and after implementation
   - Compare key UI components to ensure consistent styling
   - Verify across multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

2. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use tools like Lighthouse or axe to verify color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Test keyboard navigation flows remain functional
   - Verify screen reader compatibility for critical elements

3. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify consistent appearance in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Check that animations and transitions work properly across browsers

4. User Experience Validation:
   - Conduct a small user test with 3-5 users to gather feedback on the new design
   - Create a checklist of specific UI improvements and verify each is implemented
   - Time key user flows to ensure design changes don't negatively impact performance

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure load times before and after to ensure design enhancements don't significantly increase page weight
   - Check for animation performance issues, especially on lower-end devices

All tests should be documented with screenshots and notes for future reference.
