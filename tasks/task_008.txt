# Task ID: 8
# Title: Query Processing with Graph-Based Retrieval
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate and extend LightRAG's native query processing capabilities for contextual responses.
# Details:
LightRAG already provides most of the required query processing functionality natively, including graph traversal, context retrieval, ranking/filtering, and response generation. The task now focuses on integrating with these existing capabilities, exposing additional query parameters/modes in the API, adding custom query preprocessing if needed, and ensuring proper integration with our application.

# Test Strategy:
Test the integration with LightRAG's query processing capabilities. Verify that all query modes (local, global, hybrid, mix) work correctly. Ensure proper source attribution and response relevance.

8. Measure response quality and relevance with automated metrics

## 5. Implement Source Attribution Tracking [completed]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.4
### Description: Add a system to track and attribute which parts of the knowledge base were used in generating responses, providing transparency and verification
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a SourceTracker class to record which nodes and relationships were used
2. Implement methods to associate specific response segments with source nodes
3. Develop a citation format for including sources in responses
4. Add metadata enrichment for sources (confidence level, timestamp, author)
5. Create an attribution storage system for audit and verification
6. Implement an API endpoint to retrieve full source details for any response
7. Add visualization capabilities for source relationships
8. Test attribution accuracy by comparing retrieved sources with response content
