# Task ID: 13
# Title: Real-time Message Streaming
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement streaming of AI responses in real-time as they are generated.
# Details:
Modify the backend to stream LightRAG responses as they are generated, improving perceived response time and user experience. Update the existing WebSocket implementation to handle streaming messages. Create a frontend component that displays streaming text with appropriate typing animations to create a more engaging chat experience. Implement cancel functionality to allow users to interrupt long responses. Add error handling for interrupted streams. This enhancement builds on top of the working LightRAG integration which currently returns complete responses.

# Test Strategy:
Test streaming with various response lengths to ensure consistent performance. Verify text appears incrementally in real-time with natural typing animations. Test the cancel functionality to ensure long responses can be interrupted. Check error recovery if connection is interrupted. Compare user experience with streaming vs. non-streaming responses.
