# Task ID: 10
# Title: React/Next.js Frontend Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the frontend project with React/Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create a ChatGPT-like interface for the LightRAG system.
# Details:
Enhance the existing Next.js frontend with improved UI/UX features. The basic chat interface, document upload functionality, API integration with backend, and real-time chat communication are already implemented. Focus on enhancing the user experience with better styling, improved file upload capabilities, persistent chat history, better loading states, user-friendly error handling, responsive design, keyboard shortcuts, and message actions. The goal is to polish the functional frontend to make it production-ready with a modern, intuitive interface following the design patterns shown in the YouTube tutorial and ottomator-agents example.

# Test Strategy:
Verify enhanced UI components render correctly. Test improved file upload with drag-and-drop and progress tracking. Verify chat history persistence across sessions. Test loading states and error messages for user-friendliness. Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes. Test keyboard shortcuts functionality. Verify message actions like copy and regenerate work correctly.
