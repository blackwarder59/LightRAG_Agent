# Task ID: 5
# Title: Document Upload and Processing API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create API endpoints for document upload and processing with progress tracking.
# Details:
Successfully implemented a file upload endpoint at /api/documents/upload that accepts multiple file formats including .docx, .pdf, .txt, and .md files. Created a background task system for processing documents asynchronously with LightRAG integration. Implemented progress tracking and document status updates. Added proper error handling and validation for file uploads. The system supports batch processing for multiple documents and stores upload metadata in the database.

# Test Strategy:
Tested file upload with various document sizes and formats (.docx, .pdf, .txt, .md). Verified progress updates are sent correctly. Confirmed error handling works properly for invalid files.
