# Task ID: 2
# Title: FastAPI Backend Server Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a basic FastAPI server with initial route structure and WebSocket support.
# Details:
Set up a FastAPI application with CORS middleware, basic error handling, and logging. Create route groups for document processing, chat, and knowledge management. Implement WebSocket endpoint for real-time chat. Configure dependency injection for database connections and LLM clients. Set up Redis connection for session management.

# Test Strategy:
Test server startup and basic endpoint health checks. Verify WebSocket connection can be established.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Basic FastAPI Server Configuration with CORS and Logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational FastAPI application with CORS middleware, error handling, and logging configuration
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a new FastAPI application instance
2. Configure CORS middleware with appropriate origins, methods, and headers
3. Set up application-wide exception handlers for common HTTP errors (404, 500, etc.)
4. Implement a logging system using Python's logging module with different log levels
5. Create a basic health check endpoint at '/health'
6. Organize the project structure with separate directories for routes, models, services, and utilities
7. Testing approach: Write tests to verify CORS headers, error responses, and logging functionality

## 2. Route Group Structure Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the API route groups for document processing, chat, and knowledge management with basic endpoint structure
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create APIRouter instances for each functional area: document processing, chat, and knowledge management
2. Define the basic route structure for each group with appropriate path prefixes
3. Implement skeleton endpoints with proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
4. Add request validation using Pydantic models for each endpoint
5. Include basic response models and status codes
6. Register all routers with the main FastAPI application
7. Testing approach: Write tests for route registration, path validation, and basic request/response validation

## 3. WebSocket Endpoint for Real-time Chat [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement WebSocket support for real-time chat functionality
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a WebSocket endpoint at '/ws/chat/{session_id}'
2. Implement connection handling (accept, disconnect)
3. Set up message receiving and sending functionality
4. Add session tracking to manage multiple concurrent connections
5. Implement basic message validation and error handling
6. Create a message queue system for handling multiple messages
7. Add authentication for WebSocket connections
8. Testing approach: Use WebSocket testing tools to verify connection establishment, message sending/receiving, and proper disconnection handling

## 4. Dependency Injection System Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Configure dependency injection for database connections and LLM clients
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create dependency provider functions for database connections
2. Implement dependency functions for LLM client initialization
3. Set up connection pooling for database access
4. Add configuration for different environments (development, testing, production)
5. Implement graceful connection handling and resource cleanup
6. Create mock dependencies for testing purposes
7. Add dependency overrides for different contexts
8. Testing approach: Write tests to verify dependency injection, connection management, and proper resource cleanup

## 5. Redis Integration for Session Management [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.4
### Description: Set up Redis connection and implement session management functionality
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Add Redis client library and configure connection parameters
2. Implement session creation, retrieval, and expiration functionality
3. Create utility functions for session data serialization/deserialization
4. Set up appropriate TTL (Time To Live) for session data
5. Implement session cleanup for expired sessions
6. Create a session middleware for automatic session handling
7. Add session persistence across application restarts
8. Testing approach: Use Redis mocking to test session operations, expiration handling, and data persistence
