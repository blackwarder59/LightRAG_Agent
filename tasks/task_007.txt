# Task ID: 7
# Title: Text Chunking and Knowledge Graph Construction
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement automatic chunking of document text and construction of the knowledge graph.
# Details:
LightRAG already handles the entire knowledge graph pipeline internally: text chunking with intelligent boundaries, entity and relationship extraction, knowledge graph construction, and database persistence. The lightrag_service.py provides the necessary service layer for knowledge graph operations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify LightRAG's built-in functionality for text chunking, entity extraction, relationship mapping, and knowledge graph construction using sample documents. Confirm proper storage and retrieval from nano-vectordb.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Text Chunking Algorithm [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an algorithm that segments document text into appropriate chunk sizes for processing
### Details:
COMPLETED: No implementation needed as LightRAG handles text chunking internally with intelligent chunk boundaries. LightRAG automatically segments text with appropriate chunk sizes and handles different document formats.

## 2. Implement Context Preservation Between Chunks [completed]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Enhance the chunking algorithm to maintain context between adjacent text chunks
### Details:
COMPLETED: No implementation needed as LightRAG's chunking system already preserves context between chunks with appropriate overlap and maintains document structure.

## 3. Implement Entity Extraction Using LightRAG [completed]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create a service to extract entities from text chunks using LightRAG
### Details:
COMPLETED: No implementation needed as LightRAG automatically extracts entities from text. Testing confirmed successful extraction of 5 entities in our test document.

## 4. Implement Relationship Extraction and Mapping [completed]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create a service to identify relationships between entities using LightRAG
### Details:
COMPLETED: No implementation needed as LightRAG automatically identifies relationships between entities. Testing confirmed successful extraction of 3 relationships in our test document.

## 5. Implement Knowledge Graph Database Storage [completed]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create database models and storage mechanisms for the knowledge graph
### Details:
COMPLETED: No implementation needed as LightRAG automatically persists the knowledge graph to disk using nano-vectordb and graph files.

## 6. Create Knowledge Graph Service Layer [completed]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Implement a service layer to manage knowledge graph operations and integrate all components
### Details:
COMPLETED: No implementation needed as the service layer already exists in lightrag_service.py, which provides all necessary functionality for knowledge graph operations.

## 7. Verify LightRAG Knowledge Graph Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test and document LightRAG's built-in knowledge graph capabilities
### Details:
Document the existing LightRAG knowledge graph functionality: 1) Run comprehensive tests with various document types to verify chunking, entity extraction, and relationship mapping, 2) Create documentation on how to configure and optimize LightRAG's knowledge graph features, 3) Develop examples showing how to query and utilize the knowledge graph in our application, 4) Verify performance and scalability with larger documents.
