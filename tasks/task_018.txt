# Task ID: 18
# Title: Document and Create User Guide for LightRAG Server Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation and a user guide for the implemented LightRAG server with knowledge graph visualization capabilities.
# Details:
Following the successful implementation of the official LightRAG server using Docker, we need to document the setup process and create a user guide to ensure knowledge transfer within the team. The documentation should include:

1. Detailed setup instructions including Docker commands, environment variables, and configuration options
2. System architecture overview explaining how the LightRAG server integrates with our existing systems
3. Guide for using the web UI with screenshots of key features
4. Instructions for knowledge graph exploration and visualization capabilities
5. Common troubleshooting steps and solutions
6. Performance considerations and optimization tips
7. Comparison between our custom solution attempts and the official implementation, highlighting lessons learned
8. Security considerations and best practices
9. Backup and maintenance procedures

The documentation should be written in Markdown format and stored in the project's documentation repository. Include code snippets where appropriate and ensure all configuration options are thoroughly explained.

# Test Strategy:
The documentation will be validated through the following methods:

1. Peer review by at least two team members who weren't involved in the implementation
2. Validation test where a developer with no prior knowledge of LightRAG follows the documentation to set up a new instance from scratch
3. User testing of the web UI guide by having team members follow the instructions and provide feedback
4. Verification that all features mentioned in the documentation are actually available in the implementation
5. Check that all Docker configuration options are correctly documented by comparing with official LightRAG documentation
6. Ensure troubleshooting section addresses common issues by having team members review based on their experience
7. Validate that security considerations are comprehensive by having a security-focused team member review
8. Test the backup procedures by performing a backup and restore according to the documentation
