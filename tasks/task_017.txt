# Task ID: 17
# Title: Create GitHub Repository and Push Initial Codebase
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a GitHub repository for the project and push the initial codebase that includes the FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, Docker configuration, and TaskMaster files.
# Details:
1. Create a new GitHub repository with an appropriate name for the project
2. Configure repository settings including branch protection rules for the main branch
3. Add a comprehensive README.md file that includes:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - System architecture description
   - Setup and installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - API documentation overview
4. Add a .gitignore file appropriate for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript projects
5. Add an open source license file (MIT recommended unless otherwise specified)
6. Push the initial commit (hash: 6085588) containing all 55 files and 7,509 lines of code
7. Create and push development and feature branches according to GitFlow methodology
8. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline integration
9. Configure repository collaborators and access permissions
10. Add project tags/releases for the initial version

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the GitHub repository is accessible to all team members
2. Confirm all 55 files are present in the repository with the correct directory structure
3. Validate that the commit hash 6085588 is present in the repository history
4. Check that the README.md contains all required sections and is properly formatted
5. Ensure .gitignore is properly configured by testing with common excluded files
6. Verify branch protection rules are working by attempting to push directly to main
7. Test GitHub Actions workflows by making a small change and confirming the pipeline runs
8. Confirm repository visibility settings match project requirements (public/private)
9. Verify all team members have appropriate access levels
10. Validate that the repository can be cloned and the application can be built and run successfully from the cloned code
