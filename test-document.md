# LightRAG Test Document

This is a test document for validating our LightRAG integration.

## Key Concepts
- **Artificial Intelligence**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines
- **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Structured representations of knowledge using entities and relationships

## Relationships
AI encompasses Machine Learning. Knowledge Graphs help organize information for AI systems.

## Testing Goals
1. Validate document processing pipeline
2. Test entity extraction capabilities  
3. Verify relationship mapping
4. Confirm timeout and monitoring systems

This document should process quickly and demonstrate all core LightRAG features.
